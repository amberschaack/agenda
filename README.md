# Agenda

Agenda is my Solo Project from my time at Emerging Digital Academy in Fargo, North Dakota. It is a user focused application that simplifies and streamlines group events.

## Description

Agenda is a simple, yet interactive, way to plan events with your friends! Remove the hassle of scrolling through endless group messages by having all of your event information in one place. Agenda allows users to join exisiting groups and create their own groups. Within each group, a member is able to RSVP to current events and create their own events.

### Duration

- 2 week sprint

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- Node.js
- PostrgeSQL
- Nodemon

### Create Database and Tables

- Create a new database called 'agenda' and use the queries in the database.sql file to set up your tables.
- If you would like to name your database something else, you will need to change 'agenda' to the name of your new database name in server/modules/pool.js

### Development Setup Instructions

- Run npm install
- Start postgres
- Run npm run server
- Run npm run client
- Navigate to localhost:5001

## Acknowledgement

Thanks to Emerging Digital Academy who equipped and helped me to make this application a reality. It will be something that I implement in my small business and I hope to keep developing to make a customer-facing application as well. Also, a huge thanks to my cohort mates, we all leaned on each other and helped each other through these projects and I'm grateful to have gone through this process with you.
